                <p id="Gladious">
                    Commonly called “glads,” these lovely flowering plants are available in a multitude of colors and typically reach between 2 and 5 feet in height.
                     Their blooms also range in size—from “miniature” flowers less than 3 inches in diameter, to “giant” flowers greater than 5 inches across!

                <p id="Gladious">
                    The taller varieties, which need to be staked, are often placed in the back of a garden to nicely complement shorter plants.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p id="Gladious">
                    Note: Gladiolus plants are winter hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 8 and warmer. In Zones 7 and colder, gladioli corms should be dug
                    up in the fall, stored, and replanted the following spring. Find your planting zone here and see instructions for this process below.

                    <p id="Peruvian">
                    Alstroemeria commonly called the Peruvian lily or lily of the Incas, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alstroemeriaceae.
                    They are all native to South America although some have become naturalized in the United States, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand,
                    Madeira and the Canary Islands. Almost all of the species are restricted to one of two distinct centers of diversity,one in central
                    Chile, the other in eastern Brazil. Species of Alstroemeria from Chile are winter-growing plants while those of Brazilare summer
                    growing. All are long-lived perennials except A. graminea, a diminutive annual from the Atacama Desert of Chile.

                    he vibrant and long-lasting Peruvian lily is native to South America, but its appeal has spread far beyond the land of its origin. Reminiscent
                    of miniature lilies, Peruvian lilies can be found in a variety of colors, including brilliant shades of yellow, pink, orange, and white.

                <p id="Doritaenopsis">
                    Doritaenopsis (abbreviated Dtps. in the horticultural trade) was a genus of artifical hybrids first formally described in 1935 by André Guillaumin
                    in the Archives du Muséum national d'histoire naturelle. In the 1950's, Doritis pulcherrima (now known as Phalaenopsis pulcherrima) was crossed with
                    Phalaenopsis equestris producing Doritaenopsis hybrids with more flowers with more intense pink than those of the Phalaenopsis parent and in 1975,
                    Doritaenopsis Memoria Clarence Schubert 'Malibu Dream' was registered with the American Orchid Society, a specimen producing "an inflorescence nearly
                    8 ft (2.4 m) tall with five branches, 75 flowers and 29 buds", with "individual flowers measured 8.0 cm (3.1 in) across.

                <p id="Doritaenopsis">
                    Doritaenopsis cultivars and 3 Phalaenopsis cultivars were used for meiotic analysis. Pollinia of full bloom flowers were collected for sporad
                    analysis according to previous reports (Bolaños-Villegas and Chen, 2007; Bolaños-Villegas et al., 2008). Briefly, the pollinia were fixed with 95%
                    ethanol-glacial acetic acid (3:1 by vol), hydrolyzed in 1 N HCl, and Pollen mother cells (PMCs) stained with lactophenol-acid fuchsin solution.
